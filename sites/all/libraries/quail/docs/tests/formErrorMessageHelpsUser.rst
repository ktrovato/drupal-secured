===============================
Forms offer the user a way to check the results of their form before performing an irrevokable action

*Severity code:* Information only

.. php:class:: formErrorMessageHelpsUser


If the form allows users to perform some irrevokable action, like ordreing a product, ensure that users have the ability to review the contents of the form they submitted first. This is not something that can be checked through automated testing and requires manual confirmation.
