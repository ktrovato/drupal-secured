ImageCache Token
================

Module provides additional tokens for image fields. For each image style 
available additional token [node:field_image_field:style_name] will be 
provided.

## Installation

Copy module to sites/all/modules folder and activate ImageCache Token 
module in admin panel.

## Configuration

No module configuration needed. 

## Gotchas

I've observed that after you create new image style it might not appear 
immediately in available tokens list. If this is a case, you will need 
to reset cache at Performance page.
