IMPORTANTÂ NOTICE
================

Enforce revlog will only be enabled for a node when a revision is about
to be created. Therefore it WON'T require users to enter a log message
when:

- The node is being created (no previous version exists)

- "Create new revision" is disabled (on the node form or set as a
  default through the content type configuration form)

Make sure that "Create new revision" is checked as the default behavior 
for the content types on which Enforce revlog is set.


USAGE
=====

- Enable the module "Enforce revlog" in admin/modules

- Go to admin/people/permissions to set the permission
  "skip revision log message" for relevant roles

- Go to admin/config/user-interface/enforce_revlog to configure the
  module and activate it on the content types where it is needed.

- Alternatively you can (de)activate Enforce revlog for a given content
  type on its content type editing form

- Now when a user without "skip revision log message" creates or reverts
  (if enabled) a node revision, he/she will have to enter a log message.

- If the "Create new revision" checkbox on the node editing form is
  unchecked while editing a node, Enforce Revlog will be disabled.
  If it's checked again, Enforce Revlog will be enabled again.


TIPS
====

On the node add/edit form, Enforce revlog will check if the property
$node->enforce_revlog is set before enabling itself. Therefore you can
define your very own conditions to set/unset $node->enforce_revlog in a
custom module.
