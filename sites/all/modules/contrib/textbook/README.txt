This module has been broken down into three parts in case you just want the styles it provides.
1. Textbook module - Styles and while not required, it does include the code for setting the styles available to the ckeditor.
2. Textbook templates feature - A Feature that provides well made templates for use in textbook authoring.
3. Textbook Text editor feature - A well configured implementation of CKEditor (download the latest version of the library to use this).

This project seeks to provide accessible (WCAG 2.0 AA) styles and templates that are visually appealing as well. Improvements and accessibility concerns with aspects of this project should be posted in the issue queue for the module and will be handled there.
