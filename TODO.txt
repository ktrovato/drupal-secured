Live Deault Simple Installer

1. Change zen to omega. Leave bootstrap. Make Omega default. Or just use Omega, it has a really nice desktop and mobile.

2. Replace AdvAgg?? Waiting on patch. If not fixed, will need replaced.
The developer doesn't find it exploitable. Waiting for security team recomendations.
